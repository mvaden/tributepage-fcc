            <p>A Prefatory Note By The Author Of This Page</p>
            <p>Ever since the first time I discovered the literature and public lectures of Howard Zinn a few years ago, my perspective of the American history that I've learned in my life has been permanently reshaped in a way that it will never go back
                to its previous condition. Like many of you, my primary education is rooted in public schooling. With some effort and little imagination, I successfully graduated from Middle Township High School. Immediately thereafter, I did two years
                at Atlantic Cape Community College and then three years at Rutgers, The State University Of New Jersey in New Brunswick/Piscataway. With a lot more effort, imagination and desire, I graduated with B.A. in Communication.</p>

            <p>In my last two years at Rutgers, I began taking courses from the Africana Studies Department. I recall the ever so cheerful and enthusiastic Dr. Denniston Bonadie lecturing about the history of the Pan-African diaspora as an introduction to
                the major. It bought some new facts to the table regarding the history of America. The next semester, that learning of American history went a step deeper during a semester of studying Afro-musicology - the study of Pan-African and African-American
                history through its music and communication. This really began to open my eyes in that much of what we hear and listen to today, lyrically and rhythmically, not only ties closely to the conditions that many people of color have always
                found themselves living in, but that the rhythm of music and sound is something that has continued to thrive and live well through hundreds of years of transition. And then there was the wonderful Professor Karla Jackson-Brewer lectured
                on The Black Woman, where I learned about the impacts of such early feminists like the great Ida B. Wells and others, while covering topics on the dynamics of race, gender, sex and sexuality. </p>

            <p>With the exception of Zinn, no one had more of an upsetting, enlightening, and empowering effect on the my critical thinking of history than learning about<i>The Black Experience In America: 1619 to 1980</i> through Dr. Edward Ramsamy. This
                was one of the most coveted lectures in the entire university, and was often reserved for “upperclass” learner. I can recall the sitting in Beck Hall in a capacity room with about 120 other fellow learners, waiting anxiously for what we
                thought would be a gentleman of African descent walking in, perhaps sporting long locs of hair and wearing a dashiki. I’m sure that most of us were not expecting to find a rather short man who appeared to be of Indian Descent (we later
                learned that he was actually from South Africa) in a suit and tie with glasses and a full but deceptive smile on his face. Those of us who seconded guessed what we signed up for were quickly reassured that we would certainly be getting
                our time and moneys’ worth when Professor Ramsamy immediately handed each of us a pop quiz of 20 questions of Black Trivia that most of us couldn’t answer (the only two that most were able to complete were naming a black Supreme Court
                Justice {Thurgood Marshall or Clarence Thomas} and name a black US Senator {Barack Obama, Edward Booke III, to name a few}.) No one at the time had known that Ralph Bunche was the first black person in the world, let alone from America,
                to win a Nobel Prize, in his case for peace. Nevertheless, we were humbled. We realized for the first time that history is not objective; it is always shared through a perspective lens. History curriculums in most public school systems
                teach in a very similar pattern of subconsciously emphasizing the necessary inflection points that men, almost entirely anglo-saxon and from the elite class, were the ones most responsible for shaping the course of history and direction
                in the United States, and that an eternal debt of gratitude should be owed to them without question. Never mind the losers; never mind the workers and peasants; never mind the Africans and indigenous peoples; never mind women; never mind
                progressives. Learning about the experiences of brave people like Ida B. Wells, Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. Du Bois, Malcolm X and of course Martin Luther King Jr. was an unknown precursor of what was to come over the next decade.</p>

            <p>Reading A People’s History Of The United States set into motion again everything that I had learned from my time studying Africana at Rutgers. I forced to confront the fact that American history, as it is taught from traditional text books,
                is really the white washing of anything that had a.) ever come before it, b.) existed during it’s infancy, c.) resisted western colonialism and subjugation, and d.) perished with little or no record of any kind of having existed. And when
                that happens, we do an injustice to the millions of people who didn’t have a voice to represent even so much as themselves or to have an ounce of dignity in the face of something worse. Even with King and X, it was through Zinn that I
                learned that the plight of an often ignored or forgotten people is not just the experience of Black people around the world; it is felt by the poor and many middle classes, by women, by children (especially girls), Haitians and their Dominican
                counterparts, by Kurds and Palestineians, Jews and Gentiles, Prostintants and Catholics, Muslims and Christians, Tibetan Buddhists and many others who I’m either forgetting to mention or do not yet know about.</p>

            <p>The goal of this tribute page is really to serve as proof of my fledgling skill set as a Full-Stack Web Develop. They say the easiest way to create something is to take a serious topic of interest and apply it to what you want to create. I’ve
                always felt that not enough people know who Howard Zinn even is, proof of which his writings have always been and continue to be largely absent from American classrooms and educational programs, as they were from my peers and myself. This
                is my attempt at shedding just a little bit of light on his life, experiences and perspectives on what his life and the lives of many others were like in the historical scope of the United States in the 20th Century. If there are any historical
                inaccuracies you notice, wish to provide feedback on anything in particular that is subject related, or just want to say hello…please feel free to reach me <a href="mailto:m@matthewvaden.com">here</a>. You can also get to know me some
                more by having a look at my <a href="www.matthewvaden.com" target="_blank">page</a>. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>


            <p>Sincerely,</p>
