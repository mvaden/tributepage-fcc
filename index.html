        <h1><b>Dr. Howard Zinn</b></h1>
        <h2><i>The Modern Day Authority Of Civil Disobedience</i></h2>

        <p>Howard Zinn (August 24, 1922 - January 27, 2010), was an American historian, author, academic, activist and playwright. Authoring more than twenty books, he is probably best known for the highly influential, <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/materials/a-peoples-history-of-the-united-states/" target="_blank"><i>A People's History Of The United States</i></a> (1980). He published a version of it for young readers in 2007, <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/materials/a-young-peoples-history-of-the-united-states/" target="_blank"><i>A Young People's History Of The United States</i></a>.</p>

        <p>A self described <a href="http://flag.blackened.net/ias/13zinn.htm">"anarchist"</a>, <a href="http://flag.blackened.net/ias/13zinn.htm">"socialist"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ9UChMSJPU">"democratic socialist"</a>, wrote extensively about civil rights and anti-war movements, and about labor history in the United States. In 2002, his memoir <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/materials/you-cant-be-neutral-on-a-moving-train-a-personal-history-of-our-times/"><i>You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times</i></a> was published and later made into a <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/materials/you-cant-be-neutral-on-a-moving-train-dvd/">documentary</a> film in 2004.</p>

        <p>Zinn was born into a working class family of Jewish immigrants in Brooklyn. His father, Eddie Zinn, was born in Austria-Hungary, and his mother, Jenny (Rabinowitz) Zinn, was from the eastern Siberian city of Irkutsk. His parents met while working in the same factory. During the depression, they continued to work a number of jobs from ditch digging to waitering.</p>

        <p>Both had very limited formal education; only his mother was <i>partially</i> literate. Despite this, his parents introduced him to literature by purchasing each of the 20 volumes of Charles Dickens' collected works from a ten cent coupon in the New York Post. Zinn also made friends with several young and local communists, and together would attend a peaceful political rally in Times Square. Zinn recalled police, both mounted and on foot, charging at marchers and knocking him unconscious after being struck in the head by an officer. All of this would go on to have an everlasting effect on his social and political stance.</p>

        <p>At 18, Zinn went to work in the shipyard. Before long, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Force, enthusiastic to fight against facism. He served as bombardier in the 490th Bombardment Group during World War II. As the theater in Europe was concluding in April of 1945, Zinn dropped what was the first lethal use of napalm bombs on Royan, a seaside resort in western France. The mission resulted in the indiscriminate killing of more than one 1,000 French civilians, not including a small group of Nazi German soliders who had surrendered fighting and we simply waiting for the war to end. Zinn would later go on to say about the experience of those ethical dilemmas that, "When your dropping bombs from 30,000 feet in the air, you don't hear screams. You don't see blood. You don't think about the people on the ground."</p>

        <p>Zinn returned to New York City after the war. With the help of the G.I. Bill and while working nights in a Manhattan warehouse to support his wife and two small children, he began his undergraduate studies at New York University at the age of 27, graduating with a B.A. in 1951. He went on to graduate study at Columbia University, earning an M.A. (1952) and a Ph.D. in history and political science (1958). His masters' thesis examined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre">Colorado coal strikes of 1914</a>. His doctoral dissertation <i>LaGuardia in Congress</i> was a study of Fiorello H. La Guardia as a progressive Republican congressman who represented a very poor constituency in East Harlem, depicting him as "the conscience of the [roaring nineteen] twenties" and "astonishingly accurate preview of the New Deal" from a legislative standpoint. Zinn went on to be a post-doctoral fellow in East Asian Studies at Harvard in 1960-61.</p>

        <p>Zinn was offered his first teaching job in 1956 at Spelman College, a historically black college for women in Atlanta, as chair of their history department. His first act of involvement was successfully lobbying the <a href="http://thesha.org/about"></a>Southern Historical Association</p> to quit holding conferences at segregated hotels. He served as an advisor to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and wrote about their sit-in and other actions to <i>The Nation</i> and <i>Harper's</i>. In 1964, Beacon Press published his book <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/materials/sncc-the-new-abolitionists/">SNCC: The New Abolitionists</a>. As a professor and advisor, Zinn would go on to mentor a number of protégés, including but not limited to Alice Walker, Marian Wright Edelman, Bernice Johnson Reagon, and Julian Bond. At Spelman, he was known for organizing with and sometimes being jailed with students who were particiapting in the first sit-ins of the south in an effort to desegregate local restaurants and various public faclities like the Georgia State House and the Atlanta Public Library. Despite the popular support he was receiving from students at Spelman, much of the college's faculty and administration were not impressed with Zinn radicalizing black female students away from such a timid non-threating culture of social obedience. And although Zinn was a tenured professor, the angered President of Spelman dismissed him from teaching in 1963. Students campaigned to have Zinn remain at Spelman, unsuccessfully.
