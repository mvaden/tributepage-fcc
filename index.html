        <h1><b>Dr. Howard Zinn</b></h1>
        <h2><i>The Modern Day Authority Of Civil Disobedience</i></h2>

        <p>Howard Zinn (August 24, 1922 - January 27, 2010), was an American historian, author, academic, activist and playwright. Authoring more than twenty books, he is probably best known for the highly influential, <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/materials/a-peoples-history-of-the-united-states/" target="_blank"><i>A People's History Of The United States</i></a> (1980). He published a version of it for young readers in 2007, <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/materials/a-young-peoples-history-of-the-united-states/" target="_blank"><i>A Young People's History Of The United States</i></a>.</p>

        <p>A self described <a href="http://flag.blackened.net/ias/13zinn.htm">"anarchist"</a>, <a href="http://flag.blackened.net/ias/13zinn.htm">"socialist"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ9UChMSJPU">"democratic socialist"</a>, wrote extensively about civil rights and anti-war movements, and about labor history in the United States. In 2002, his memoir <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/materials/you-cant-be-neutral-on-a-moving-train-a-personal-history-of-our-times/"><i>You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times</i></a> was published and later made into a <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/materials/you-cant-be-neutral-on-a-moving-train-dvd/">documentary</a> film in 2004.</p>

        <p>Zinn was born into a working class family of Jewish immigrants in Brooklyn. His father, Eddie Zinn, was born in Austria-Hungary, and his mother, Jenny (Rabinowitz) Zinn, was from the eastern Siberian city of Irkutsk. His parents met while working in the same factory. During the depression, they continued to work a number of jobs from ditch digging to waitering.</p>

        <p>Both had very limited formal education; only his mother was <i>partially</i> literate. Despite this, his parents introduced him to literature by purchasing each of the 20 volumes of Charles Dickens' collected works from a ten cent coupon in the New York Post. Zinn also made friends with several young and local communists, and together would attend a peaceful political rally in Times Square. Zinn recalled police, both mounted and on foot, charging at marchers and knocking him unconscious after being struck in the head by an officer. All of this would go on to have an everlasting effect on his social and political stance.</p>

        <p>At 18, Zinn went to work in the shipyard. Before long, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Force, enthusiastic to fight against facism. He served as bombardier in the 490th Bombardment Group during World War II. As the theater in Europe was concluding in April of 1945, Zinn dropped what was the first lethal use of napalm bombs on Royan, a seaside resort in western France, killing numerous innocent people as well as a small group of Nazi German soliders who had surrendered fighting and we simply waiting for the war to end. Zinn would later go on to say about that incident that, "When your dropping bombs from 30,000 feet in the air, you don't hear screams. You don't see blood."</p>
