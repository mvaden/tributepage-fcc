        <p>Howard Zinn (August 24, 1922 - January 27, 2010), was an American historian, author, academic, activist and playwright. Authoring more than twenty books, he is probably best known for the highly influential, <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/materials/a-peoples-history-of-the-united-states/"
                target="_blank"><i>A People's History Of The United States</i></a> (1980). He published a version of it for young readers in 2007, <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/materials/a-young-peoples-history-of-the-united-states/" target="_blank"><i>A Young People's History Of The United States</i></a>.</p>

        <p>A self described <a href="http://flag.blackened.net/ias/13zinn.htm">"anarchist"</a>, <a href="http://flag.blackened.net/ias/13zinn.htm">"socialist"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ9UChMSJPU">"democratic socialist"</a>, wrote
            extensively about civil rights and anti-war movements, and about labor history in the United States. In 2002, his memoir <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/materials/you-cant-be-neutral-on-a-moving-train-a-personal-history-of-our-times/"><i>You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times</i></a>            was published and later made into a <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/materials/you-cant-be-neutral-on-a-moving-train-dvd/">documentary</a> film in 2004.</p>

        <p>Zinn was born into a working class family of Jewish immigrants in Brooklyn. His father, Eddie Zinn, was born in Austria-Hungary, and his mother, Jenny (Rabinowitz) Zinn, was from the eastern Siberian city of Irkutsk. His parents met while working
            in the same factory. During the depression, they continued to work a number of jobs from ditch digging to waitering.</p>

        <p>Both had very limited formal education; only his mother was <i>partially</i> literate. Despite this, his parents introduced him to literature by purchasing each of the 20 volumes of Charles Dickens' collected works from a ten cent coupon in the
            New York Post. Zinn also made friends with several young and local communists, and together would attend a peaceful political rally in Times Square. Zinn recalled police, both mounted and on foot, charging at marchers and knocking him unconscious
            after being struck in the head by an officer. All of this would go on to have an everlasting effect on his social and political stance.</p>

        <p>At 18, Zinn went to work in the shipyard. Before long, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Force, enthusiastic to fight against facism. He served as bombardier in the 490th Bombardment Group during World War II. As the theater in Europe
            was concluding in April of 1945, Zinn dropped what was the first lethal use of napalm bombs on Royan, a seaside resort in western France. The mission resulted in the indiscriminate killing of more than one 1,000 French civilians, not including
            a small group of Nazi German soliders who had surrendered fighting and we simply waiting for the war to end. Zinn would later go on to say about the experience of those ethical dilemmas that, "When your dropping bombs from 30,000 feet in the
            air, you don't hear screams. You don't see blood. You don't think about the people on the ground."</p>

        <p>Zinn married his wife, Roslyn Shechter, while on a very brief leave in 1944 (until her death in 2008) and returned to New York City after the war. With the help of the G.I. Bill and while working nights in a Manhattan warehouse to support his
            wife and two small children, he began his undergraduate studies at New York University at the age of 27, graduating with a B.A. in 1951. He went on to graduate study at Columbia University, earning an M.A. (1952) and a Ph.D. in history and
            political science (1958). His masters' thesis examined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre">Colorado coal strikes of 1914</a>. His doctoral dissertation <i>LaGuardia in Congress</i> was a study of Fiorello H. La Guardia
            as a progressive Republican congressman who represented a very poor constituency in East Harlem, depicting him as "the conscience of the [roaring nineteen] twenties" and "astonishingly accurate preview of the New Deal" from a legislative standpoint.
            Zinn went on to be a post-doctoral fellow in East Asian Studies at Harvard in 1960-61.</p>

        <p>Zinn was offered his first teaching job in 1956 at Spelman College, a historically black college for women in Atlanta, as chair of their history department. His first act of involvement was successfully lobbying the
            <a href="http://thesha.org/about"></a>Southern Historical Association to quit holding conferences at segregated hotels. He served as an advisor to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and wrote about their sit-in and other actions to <i>The Nation</i> and <i>Harper's</i>.
            In 1964, Beacon Press published his book <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/materials/sncc-the-new-abolitionists/">SNCC: The New Abolitionists</a>. As a professor and advisor, Zinn would go on to mentor a number of protégés, including but not
            limited to Alice Walker, Marian Wright Edelman, Bernice Johnson Reagon, and Julian Bond. At Spelman, he was known for organizing with and sometimes being jailed with students who were particiapting in the first sit-ins of the south in an effort
            to desegregate local restaurants and various public faclities like the Georgia State House in Albany and the Atlanta Public Library. Despite the popular support he was receiving from students at Spelman, much of the college's faculty and administration
            were not impressed with Zinn radicalizing black female students away from such a timid non-threating culture of social obedience. And although Zinn was a tenured professor, the angered President of Spelman dismissed him from teaching in 1963.
            Students campaigned to have Zinn remain at Spelman, unsuccessfully.</p>

        <p>Zinn continued living in the south during the height of the Civil Rights Movement. He continued his alliance with SNCC by doing recorded interviews with leaders like Stokley Carmichael, and various sharecroppers and children who were involved.
            He wrote copiously. He joined James Baldwin, James Forman, and other freedom riders to observe the voter registration campaign in Selma, Alagbama in October of 1963. In 1964, he traveled to Hattiesburg, Mississippi to organize for and write
            about
            <a href="http://zinnedproject.org/materials/howard-zinn-freedom-day-hattiesburg/"></a>Freedom Day. He traveled back to Selma to continue documenting the movement during the march to Montgomery in March of 1965. As Georgia resident, Zinn wrote that he observed at least 30 violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments
            of the United States Consitution in Albany, Georgia. He wrote critically of President John F. Kennedy, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover for doing very little or nothing to stop segregationists from assulting
            civil rights workers and demonstraters.</p>

        <p>In 1964, Zinn was invited to join the faculty and teach political science at Boston University. He became active in the Anti-War Movement, noting its roots came from the Civil Rights Movement: “Black civil rights activists in the South were among
            the first to resist the draft.” (You Can’t Be Neutral, p. 108) In 1966, he traveled to Japan with SNCC activist Ralph Featherstone to lecture about the Vietnam War. During this trip, he wrote hastely <a href="http://www.haymarketbooks.org/pb/Vietnam"><i>The Logic of Withdrawal</i></a>.
            Two years later, he wrote <a href="http://howardzinn.org/bibliography/books/#disobedience_and_democracy"><i> Disobedience and Democracy: Nine Fallacies of Law and Order</i></a> while visitng Hanoi. Zinn also chaired or co-chaired a number
            of strikes by faculty, administration, staff and librarians at Boston University during the 1970s. He retired from BU and from teaching in 1988. Not surprisingly, he concluded his last class early to join the picket line at BU's School of
            Nursing, to which he invited his students to join.</p>

        <p>For the duration of his public life, Zinn went on to write plays and scripts catering to the topic of civil disobedience. He lectured at schools and public instutions around the country, elaborating on the many topics with in <i>A People's History Of The United States</i>.
            He continued to be a vocal opponent of Western Imperialism and Neo-Colonialism, particularly in the wars of the Persian Gulf and Iraq. In the age of the internet and the early onset of social media, Zinn carried out his legacy to younger listeners
            as a public intellectual on American history from the standpoint of neglected minority groups - ethnic, socioeconomic, ideological and genderbased.</p>

        <p>Zinn died while visiting Santa Monica, California in 2010 on a pair of local speaking engagements.</p>

        <p>In one of his last interviews, Zinn stated that he would like to be remembered "'for introducing a different way of thinking about the world, about war, about human rights, about equality,' and for getting more people to realize that the 'power
            which rests so far in the hands of people with wealth and guns, that the power ultimately rests in people themselves and that they can use it. At certain points in history, they have used it. Black people in the South used it. People in the
            women's movement used it. People in the anti-war movement used it. People in other countries who have overthrown tyrannies have used it.'</p>
